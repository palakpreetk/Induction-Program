An accomplished academic, she holds a B.Tech and M.Tech in Electronics, followed by a Ph.D. Later, she chose to dedicate herself to teaching and guiding students in Universal Human Values, a subject introduced by AICTE to promote holistic education.

 ~• Our second lecture of the day was delivered by Arvind Dhingra Sir, who spoke about the various physical activities and student clubs in the college. He introduced us to several clubs, including the Pravas Club, ITN Club, FM Radio Station, Cosmic Club, and CML Club, explaining their purposes and encouraging us to explore the campus to see the different sports facilities.

Sir also motivated us to join activities such as NCC, NSS, or sports, emphasizing that participation in at least one is compulsory as per government guidelines for colleges. As the Director of TAC, he shared valuable insights into the importance of extracurricular involvement for personal growth and teamwork.

The session was interactive and engaging. He invited seven volunteers each from the boys’ and girls’ sides and conducted a fun activity involving hand-folding, moving in circles, and straight-line movement. The boys’ team emerged as the winners and received packets of chocolate as a reward. However, Sir highlighted that the true importance lies not in winning but in learning from challenges, staying motivated, and working harder next time.

With his lively interaction, practical advice, and encouragement, Arvind Dhingra Sir left us inspired to participate actively in campus life and to value the lessons learned through experience.

## Day 3 : 4 August 2025
~• Session by Causmic club :( Auditorium) 
On 4th August, our first lecture was conducted by Taranpreet Kaur, a senior student, who introduced us to the Cosmic Club. She explained the club’s activities in a clear and friendly manner, encouraging active interaction by answering our queries. She guided us to register via a QR code for further information and informed us that, once registration forms are released, there will be an interview process. This interview will serve as a code of conduct exercise between students and seniors, conducted strictly under the supervision of mentors and teachers.

Our second lecture of the day was by Randhir Singh Sir, who spoke about the code of conduct for examinations. He explained the examination pattern, informing us that there would be two Mid-Semester Tests (MSTs)—the first in September and the second in October or November—followed by the final semester examinations in December. He also detailed the internal assessment system, including marks awarded for  attendance. Additionally, he informed us that six marks from the induction program would be included in our records, and we would have to document this in a report to be submitted via Google Form. This was highlighted as an important responsibility for all students.
~• Our next lecture was again by Priyadarshini Ma’am on Universal Human Values. This time, she continued with UHV-3, focusing on Happiness and Prosperity. She explained that happiness can come from different sources—such as being financially secure or having healthy, understanding relationships. For strong relationships, she stressed the importance of mutual understanding rather than material wealth.

Ma’am pointed out that in today’s world, people often connect financial status with maintaining relationships, whereas in earlier times, relationships were based more on brotherhood and mutual care, which seems to be fading now. She guided us on how to identify what is truly right or wrong, and how to balance both financial well-being and relationships for a fulfilling life.

She emphasized that being financially strong does not mean we can do without family, and having family does not mean we can ignore the need for money—both are essential for proper survival and harmony. Ma’am gave an example: if a person is wealthy but their parents are not speaking to them, is that wealth truly worth it? The answer is no.

She reminded us that money alone should not define our status. Instead, we should set meaningful goals, focus on achieving them, and aim to make our parents and teachers proud. This, she said, is our prosperity goal—to see our loved ones happy through our achievements.
## Day 4 : 5 August 2025
~• We then attended a lecture on Motorsports by Gautam Morya, a senior from B4, Mechanical Engineering, who had worked on research-based projects in the field. He began by discussing two-wheeler vehicles, then moved on to four-wheelers, explaining why cars are often preferred over bikes. This led to an interactive discussion where students responded that the main reason is the better balance provided by four wheels.

He also asked questions about the Bullet motorcycle and engaged students in a conversation about its features. Moving forward, he introduced some fundamental rules for designing a good motorsport car. While students initially answered based on general understanding, he encouraged us to refer to the official rules provided in his presentation. He then explained important factors such as vehicle capacity, weight distribution, and overall balance. He had alot knowledge about motor sports car . 
 ~• Digital Marketing Club
 Our second lecture was by Amit Kamaran, who gave us a detailed introduction to the Digital Marketing Club (DMC). He explained that this club provides opportunities to learn valuable skills such as video editing, photography, choreography, Canva designing, painting, and the use of various digital applications. Members can explore different apps, tools, and websites related to the digital marketing field.

He shared that students could create videos showcasing the college campus, produce popular reels, and gain appreciation from the college for their creative work. He emphasized the growing demand for digital skills in today’s world and how DMC can help students develop expertise in areas like videography, editing, digital art, dramatic photography, and even Ghibli-style artwork.

As the administrator and coordinator of the Digital Marketing Club, Amit Kamaran encouraged us to enroll and make the most of the resources, workshops, and opportunities available. His presentation was clear, inspiring, and highlighted the importance of developing digital skills for both personal growth and career prospects.
~• Lecture by Shaffy Makkar
Our last lecture, lasting 2–3 hours, was conducted by Mrs. Shafi Makkar , an expert in nutrition and healthy foods. She delivered a detailed and insightful session on Millets, describing them as a superfood. She explained what millets are and introduced us to various types, including Ragi (finger millet), Kutni, Kundani, Bajra (pearl millet), and Maize, noting that they are excellent alternatives to wheat and refined flour.

Mrs. Makkad explained how millets can be cooked, processed, and incorporated into a healthy diet. She acknowledged that some people avoid them because of their taste but provided practical tips and recipes to make them more appealing. She specifically recommended including Ragi in our mothers’ diets to help prevent osteoporosis, given its rich calcium content.

Benefits of Millets:
